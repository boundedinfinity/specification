    (See [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/overseas-territories].) ISO
    3166-1 contains entries for twelve of the fourteen British Overseas Territories.
    The two British Overseas Territories omitted from ISO 3166-1 are the British Antarctic
    Territory (ISO includes no national Antarctic claims) and the Sovereign Base Area

  additionalInfo: 'In the Short Name, Full Name, and at least one Local Short Name
    a preceding definite article "the" appears that should not be used in the context
    of the GENC Standard. Based on research into the British Overseas Territories
    (which include: Akrotiri and Dhekelia; Anguilla; Bermuda; British Antarctic Territory;
    British Indian Ocean Territories; Cayman Islands; Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas);
    Gibraltar; Montserrat; Pitcairn Island; Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da
    Cunha; South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands; Turks and Caicos Islands and
    the Virgin Islands, British), those territories are considered external to the
    territory of the United Kingdom. (See [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/overseas-territories].)
    And ISO 3166-1 represents 12 of the 14 territories with specific entries; it does
    not include an entry for the British Antarctic Territory, or for the Sovereign
    Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Thus either those U.K. Sovereign Base Areas
    are unrepresented in ISO 3166-1, or they are represented under the entry named
    "UNITED KINGDOM". Even if the Sovereign Base Areas were covered using the code
    elements for the U.K., it is not clear whether ISO 3166-1 would be making the
    assertion that their territory is part of the U.K. (esecially when the U.K. does
    not make that assertion).'
